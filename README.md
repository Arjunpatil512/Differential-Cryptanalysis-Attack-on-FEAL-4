# Differential-Cryptanalysis-Attack-on-FEAL-4
As part of my dissertation to finish my Math's degree regarding Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis, as well as different cryptosystem's resistance to them both theoretically and practically speaking, I took the time to study and rewrite Jon King's differential cryptanalysis on the FEAL-4 cryptosystem. 

The file is programmed in C and commented in Catalan, which is my native language and the one I used to defend my dissertation, which can be found at: http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/122710. 

The original file regarding this attack can be found at Jon King's website: http://theamazingking.com
